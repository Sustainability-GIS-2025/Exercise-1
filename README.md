# Exercise 1

The exercise for this week is meant to:
  
1. reflect your thoughts about sustainability
2. and help you get going with Python and learn to use our course environment.  
  
You will practice saving changes to your files using Git and GitHub. You will also get to practice the Markdown syntax. If using Git, GitHub and Python is familiar to you, GOOD, then this Exercise should be fairly straightforward for you. But if not, then this is a good "warm up" Exercise to get you going.

For each week, you will have a short written assignment based on the topic of the
week (based on slides + other materials) and typically a couple of programming assignments that helps you to apply the SDS methods taught at a given week.
