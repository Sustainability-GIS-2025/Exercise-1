    "\n",
    "Exercise 1 includes a **written assignment** (10 points) and a **programming assignment with 3 problems** (9 points) and a **feedback/workload assessment assignment** (1 point). For each problem you need to modify the notebook by adding your own programming solutions or written text. Remember to save and commit your changes locally, and push your changes to GitHub after each major change! Regular commits will help you to keep track of your changes (and revert them if needed). Pushing your work to GitHub will ensure that you don't lose any work in case your computer crashes (can happen!).\n",

    "### Time allocation\n",
    "\n",
    "**Completing this exercise takes approximately: 8-12 hours** (based on previous year statistics). However, the time it takes can vary significantly from student to student, so we **recommended that you start immediately working on the exercise to avoid issues meeting with the deadline**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Due date\n",
    "\n",
    "You should submit (push) your Exercise answers to your personal Github repository **by Friday 24.1** (by 23:59). \n",

    "### Start your exercise in CSC Noppe\n",
    "\n",
    "Before you can start programming, you need to launch the CSC Notebook instance and clone your **personal copy of the Exercise repository** (i.e. something like `exercise-1-htenkanen`) there using Git. If you need help with this, [read the documentation on the course site](https://sustainability-gis.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/git-basics.html).\n",

These admin levels are used in order to render different borders consistently among countries. E.g `admin_level=\"10\"` is typically used to render districts, neighborhoods and so on, whereas `admin_level=\"4\"` is typically used to draw provinces, regions, federal states etc. These values are country specific, hence, if you work in other countries please take a look at the country specific table from the [OSM docs](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Tag:boundary%3Dadministrative#admin_level).
